#### In this project You should install 
numpy
,pandas
,sklearn
,PIL,pytorch for CNN

###IMPORTANT: The main.py include the SVM method for Task A1,A2 and Random Forest, SVM method for Task B1,B2. The CNN method not inside the main.py. You can find CNN method of each task in their seperate folder. The CNN methods end with _CNN.ipynb ###

### Add the front address before /Dataset/dataset_AMLS_22-23/.... to replace the .. in each root for smooth running and please add a Dataset folder before running

  In A1,A2, we first read the images and then use PCA to reduce the dimensionality, and then use SVM to classify them.
  The B1,B2 multiclassification problem is similar to A1,A2, but we choose to use more random forest methods here as a comparison, here we will find that the accuracy is lower than the binary classification.
